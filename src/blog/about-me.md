Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nibras Ramzy, a CS student at IPB University, learning to wrangle bits and bytes while simultaneously trying to wrangle enough sleep to function (not always successful).

I have a soft spot for game jams, there's something magical about creating a world from scratch within a set theme and a limited timeframe. I'm also dipping my toes in CTF, but for now, let's just say I'm still finding my balance.

I have a love-hate relationship with my projects. Despite the countless hours I pour into them, I can't help but cringe at most of the things I make, which I kinda regret, to be honest, since most of the time I end up scrapping the project altogether.

Anyway, that's a very brief explanation about me. Join me on this wild coding journey, where every bug is a puzzle waiting to be solved. ðŸš€
